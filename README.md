This is a guide to initialize the application on its development mode.

You must run two scripts to start using this project. The first one initiates the json-server on the default port 3333 of a Node.js api. The second one starts the ReactJS environment in its default port 3000.

In different consoles run `npm run-script dev` or `yarn dev` and `npm run-script start` or `yarn start`. Keep them running.
